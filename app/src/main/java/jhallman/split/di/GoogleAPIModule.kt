/**
 * Created by Jacob on 2018-02-16.
 * In Dagger 2, classes annotated with @Module are responsible for providing objects which can be injected.
 * The @Module annotation tells Dagger that the AppModule class will provide dependencies for a part of the application.
 * It is normal to have multiple Dagger modules in a project, and it is typical for one of them to provide app-wide dependencies.
